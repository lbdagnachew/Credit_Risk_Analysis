# Credit_Risk_Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to build and evaluate various machine learning models to evaluate individual customer credit risk. The dataset used to train the models was from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company.

The machine learning algorithms used inclue:
* imbalanced-learn
* scikit-learn
* RandomOverSampler
* SMOTE algorithms
* ClusterCentroids algorithm
* SMOTEENN algorithm
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier (bias reduction model)
* EasyEnsembleClassifier (bias reduction model)

Result: the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier proved to the be the best test performed due to its accuracy score of around 99%.
